	<summary><strong>Part A: MQTT Messaging</strong></summary>

## Part A: MQTT Messaging

MQTT = lightweight messaging for IoT. Publish/subscribe model with central broker.

**Concepts:**

- **Broker**: `farlab.infosci.cornell.edu:1883`
- **Topic**: Like `IDD/bedroom/temperature` (use `#` wildcard)
- **Publish/Subscribe**: Send and receive messages

**Install MQTT tools on your Pi:**

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y mosquitto-clients
```

**Test it:**

**Subscribe to messages (listener):**

```bash
mosquitto_sub -h farlab.infosci.cornell.edu -p 1883 -t 'IDD/#' -u idd -P 'device@theFarm'
```

**Publish a message (sender):**

```bash
mosquitto_pub -h farlab.infosci.cornell.edu -p 1883 -t 'IDD/test/yourname' -m 'Hello!' -u idd -P 'device@theFarm'
```

> **💡 Tips:**
>
> - Replace `yourname` with your actual name in the topic
> - Use single quotes around the password: `'device@theFarm'`

**🔧 Debug Tool:** View all MQTT messages in real-time at `http://farlab.infosci.cornell.edu:5001`

**\*\*\*Brainstorm 5 ideas for messaging between devices\*\*\***

### <mark>AI Ideation Sessions</mark>

<mark>Taking inspiration from product studio, we decided to utilize AI to do a rapid ideation session to generate a few adjacent ideas to what we were thinking of. The original theme to begin the permutations included various MQTT and affective computing related ideas. We decided to settle on a classic idea in the world of creative technology, Telepresent Emotion Cubes.</mark>

| #     | Concept                   | Description / Interaction                                                                                                                                                        |
| ----- | ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1** | Telepresent Emotion Cubes | Small acrylic cubes that glow in colors matching remote users’ facial or vocal emotion. OpenCV-based emotion detection → MQTT broadcast → LED diffusion through frosted acrylic. |
| **2** | Mood Beacon Lamps         | Cylindrical desk lights that collectively visualize shared team mood. Users tap the lamp to select emotion; color syncs with others via MQTT topics for ambient awareness.       |
| **3** | Pulse Orbs                | Handheld diffused lights that emit rhythmic glow mirroring a user’s heartbeat. Heart rate sensor normalizes pulse → brightness modulation to create calm biofeedback loops.      |
| **4** | Weather Spirits           | Portable diffused lights reflecting remote environmental data (like sunlight or weather). Cloud API maps temperature and condition data to animated color gradients.             |
| **5** | Memory Stones             | Acrylic diffusers that store and replay past collective color states. Shared color history replays as a soft gradient loop representing group continuity over time.              |

	<summary><strong>Part B: Collaborative Pixel Grid</strong></summary>

## Part B: Collaborative Pixel Grid

Each Pi = one pixel, controlled by RGB sensor, displayed in real-time grid.

**Architecture:** `Pi (sensor) → MQTT → Server → Web Browser`

**Setup:**

1. **Sensor**

#### Light/Proximity/Gesture sensor (APDS-9960)

We use this sensor [Adafruit APDS-9960](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3595) for this exmaple to detect light (also RGB)

<img src="https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/970x728/3595-06.jpg" width=200>

Connect it to your pi with Qwiic connector

<img src="imgs/IMG_0270.jpg" height="200" />
We need to use the screen to display the color detection, so we need to stop the running piscreen.service to make your screen available again

```bash
# stop the screen service
sudo systemctl stop piscreen.service
```

if you want to restart the screen service

```bash
# start the screen service
sudo systemctl start piscreen.service
```

2. **Server** (one person on laptop):

```bash
cd "Lab 6"
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements-server.txt
python app.py
```

2. **View in browser:**

   - Grid: `http://farlab.infosci.cornell.edu:5000`
   - Controller: `http://farlab.infosci.cornell.edu:5000/controller`

3. **Pi publisher** (everyone on their Pi):

```bash
# First time setup - create virtual environment
cd "Lab 6"
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements-pi.txt

# Run the publisher

python pixel_grid_publisher.py
```

Hold colored objects near sensor to change your pixel!

**\*\*\*1. Project Description\*\*\***

### <mark>Description</mark>

<mark> Telepresent Emotion Cubes are an MQTT networked system of illuminated modules that visualize and transmit human emotion. Each cube features an OpenCV-based facial expression detector that analyzes the user’s face in real time through the webcam. Detected emotions are displayed through a frosted acrylic enclosure, diffusing internal LEDs into a soft, ambient glow. As emotion shifts, the cubes change color and publish their data across the network, enabling feedback between screen recognition and physical illumination. This interface allows users to physically see their emotional state in both the interface and the surrounding light. </mark>

|   Emotion    |   RGB Values    | Color  | Swatch |
| :----------: | :-------------: | :----: | :----: |
|  **Happy**   |  `255, 200, 0`  | Yellow |   🟨   |
|   **Sad**    |   `0, 0, 255`   |  Blue  |   🟦   |
|  **Angry**   |   `255, 0, 0`   |  Red   |   🟥   |
| **Neutral**  | `255, 255, 255` | White  |  ⬜️   |
| **Surprise** |  `0, 255, 255`  |  Cyan  |  🟦🟩  |
| **Disgust**  |   `0, 255, 0`   | Green  |   🟩   |
|   **Fear**   |  `180, 0, 255`  | Purple |   🟪   |

**\*\*\*2. Architecture Diagram\*\*\***

### <mark>Initial Code</mark>

<mark> Our code can be found at [emotion_led.py](https://github.com/thomknoe/INFO-5345/blob/Fall2025/Lab%206/emotion_led.py) </mark>

<mark> _**AI Usage:** Utilized assistance from ChatGPT for the writing of code._ </mark>

<mark> _**Pros:** ChatGPT was able to come up with a comprehensive list of dependencies that would suffice for this project which normally would take a long time searching through pip, or some other package manager._ </mark>

<mark> _**Cons:** The code base for these dependencies were out of date and therefore required very specific versions to be installed on each individual Pi so as to not differ from the code that would be provided in reference to a specific dependency library. This actually proved to be so unreliable and so detrimental that we had to utilize another Pi, because all the dependencies were clashing with each other, even within a contained virtual environment._ </mark>

<mark> This code is the boiler plate code that showcases how emotion and sentiment is derived from user's facial expressions. This instance would then be applied across all individual cubes and be networks together through MQTT subscription. This could allow for a variety of different telepresent interactions, being able to interpret emotions across a network (e.g., havign two participants know the emotional affect of their partner remotley). For our purposes, we decided to collect all these emotions (i.e., 3 Pis) and combine them to create a blended color; An amalgamation of all the emotions on the network. </mark>

**\*\*\*3. Build Documentation\*\*\***

### <mark>Fabrication Process</mark>

<mark> The cubes were made from laser, cut wood panels, and a layer of frosted white acrylic and diffused clear acrylic. This is so that the light would be able to diffuse across the top surface of each cube. The main electronics componenents included integrating WS2812B RGB LEDs for the addressable lights. Each assembly was compact for each cubic enclosure. Openings were made for USB and USB-C ports. </mark>

### <mark>Materials</mark>

- <mark> Raspberry Pi 5 Model B/8GB </mark>
- <mark> WS2812B RGB LED Rings 7 Bits </mark>
- <mark> Basswood Panels (1/16") </mark>
- <mark> Translucent Acrylic (1/8") </mark>
- <mark> Diffuse Acrylic (1/8") </mark>

**\*\*\*4. User Testing\*\*\***

### <mark>Testing & Setup</mark>

- <mark> Our code can be found at [emotion_publisher.py](https://github.com/thomknoe/INFO-5345/blob/Fall2025/Lab%206/emotion_publisher.py) </mark>

- <mark> Our web app can be found at [app.py](https://github.com/thomknoe/INFO-5345/blob/Fall2025/Lab%206/app.py) + [index.html](https://github.com/thomknoe/INFO-5345/blob/Fall2025/Lab%206/templates/index.html) </mark>

<mark> _**AI Usage:** Utilized assistance from ChatGPT for the writing of code._ </mark>

<mark> _**Pros:** Transitioning from following a incremental coding procedure, where we began with local publishers and then extended to an MQTT server hosted on flask was very seamless.._ </mark>

<mark> _**Cons:** As with before, it was critical to ensure that all the dependencies were of the correct version across each individual Pi, otherwise it would lead to problems with publishing to the broker, utilizing the GPIO pins, or accessing another peripheral._ </mark>

<mark> For testing purposes, we decided to array the cubes out on a desk facing the monitor where the web app would display the colors and blend them together, alongside the video feed and the OpenCV inference. However, this set up can also be arranged in a variety of remote environments and discrete situations, allowing for the telepresent aspects to fully come into effect. This testing set up was made so that all inputs and outputs could be situated in one place, so as to record and document clearly.</mark>

<mark> One issue with this generated code is the amount of latency that is present when reading emotions directly from a live feed camera using OpenCV. This latency also factored into problems with the color display, whereby delays between the inference and the MQTT server caused errors in the color change or color persistence. This became apparent in our user testing.</mark>

<mark> We recruited 2 users from Architecture and 1 user from Design Tech to test and experience the cubes. We approached them in-person in studio, gave a brief introduction on the project, and allowed them to enact various emotional reactions they can make in front of the webcam. Users displayed great interest in the feedback mechanism of the system, but the latency often effected the overall experience (i.e., insufficient inferencing data to display the correct light or delayed in display for the correct emotion). Ultimately, users found the experience to be delayed in interaction, yet charming and unexpected in its output, especially the color blend.</mark>

**\*\*\*5. Reflection\*\*\***

### <mark>Lab Reflection</mark>

<mark>The mapping of emotions to colors was captivating and intriguing to observe. While there are some reservations about affective computing in general, the concept of a system recognizing and displaying human emotions is often intriguing, and this lab effectively explored it. With that said, working with distributed systems was challenging due to the need for compliance and consistency across all devices. Any deviation from the norm or miscommunication regarding publisher and broker setups can cause errors (e.g., we came across an issue concerning GPIO pins that were different in programming across the Pis, perhaps due to different root dependencies).</mark>

<mark>Additionally, edge computing and machine learning introduced an elements of latency, which further complicated real-time synchronization with MQTT. This ultimatley led to an erratic display at times of the cubes, which did not correspond to the users face, but on the lack of data being read in due to lag. One benefit of this project was, due to the subjective nature of color and emotion mapping, there were no real "errors" on the user side, so to speak, just different interpretations of color. With a more step-by-step interaction and code modifications to account for waiting for responses directly from the broker before updating, the cubes can become more versatile and consistent in their outputs.</mark>
