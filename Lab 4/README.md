## Lab Overview

<mark> **Collaborators: Thomas Knoepffler, Carrie Wang, Xiaocheng Li Julia Chen, Dean Xu** </mark>

For lab this week, we focus both on sensing, to bring in new modes of input into your devices, as well as prototyping the physical look and feel of the device. You will think about the physical form the device needs to perform the sensing as well as present the display or feedback about what was sensed.

## Part 1 Lab Preparation

### Get the latest content:

As always, pull updates from the class Interactive-Lab-Hub to both your Pi and your own GitHub repo. As we discussed in the class, there are 2 ways you can do so:

Option 1: On the Pi, `cd` to your `Interactive-Lab-Hub`, pull the updates from upstream (class lab-hub) and push the updates back to your own GitHub repo. You will need the personal access token for this.

```
pi@ixe00:~$ cd Interactive-Lab-Hub
pi@ixe00:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub $ git pull upstream Fall2025
pi@ixe00:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub $ git add .
pi@ixe00:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub $ git commit -m "get lab4 content"
pi@ixe00:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub $ git push
```

Option 2: On your own GitHub repo, [create pull request](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Developing-and-Designing-Interactive-Devices/blob/2021Fall/readings/Submitting%20Labs.md) to get updates from the class Interactive-Lab-Hub. After you have latest updates online, go on your Pi, `cd` to your `Interactive-Lab-Hub` and use `git pull` to get updates from your own GitHub repo.

Option 3: (preferred) use the Github.com interface to update the changes.

### Start brainstorming ideas by reading:

- [What do prototypes prototype?](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/What-do-Prototypes-Prototype-Houde-Hill/30bc6125fab9d9b2d5854223aeea7900a218f149)
- [Paper prototyping](https://www.uxpin.com/studio/blog/paper-prototyping-the-practical-beginners-guide/) is used by UX designers to quickly develop interface ideas and run them by people before any programming occurs.
- [Cardboard prototypes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_9Q-KDSb9o) help interactive product designers to work through additional issues, like how big something should be, how it could be carried, where it would sit.
- [Tips to Cut, Fold, Mold and Papier-Mache Cardboard](https://makezine.com/2016/04/21/working-with-cardboard-tips-cut-fold-mold-papier-mache/) from Make Magazine.
- [Surprisingly complicated forms](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/50032245843343100/) can be built with paper, cardstock or cardboard. The most advanced and challenging prototypes to prototype with paper are [cardboard mechanisms](https://www.pinterest.com/helgangchin/paper-mechanisms/) which move and change.

### Part A

### Capacitive Sensing, a.k.a. Human-Twizzler Interaction

We want to introduce you to the [capacitive sensor](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-mpr121-gator) in your kit. It's one of the most flexible input devices we are able to provide. At boot, it measures the capacitance on each of the 12 contacts. Whenever that capacitance changes, it considers it a user touch. You can attach any conductive material. In your kit, you have copper tape that will work well, but don't limit yourself! In the example below, we use Twizzlers--you should pick your own objects.

<p float="left">
<img src="https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/guides/cropped_images/000/003/226/medium640/MPR121_top_angle.jpg?1609282424" height="150" />
 
</p>

Plug in the capacitive sensor board with the QWIIC connector. Connect your Twizzlers with either the copper tape or the alligator clips (the clips work better). Install the latest requirements from your working virtual environment:

These Twizzlers are connected to pads 6 and 10. When you run the code and touch a Twizzler, the terminal will print out the following

```
(circuitpython) pi@ixe00:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub/Lab 4 $ python cap_test.py
Twizzler 10 touched!
Twizzler 6 touched!
```

### More sensors

#### Light/Proximity/Gesture sensor (APDS-9960)

We here want you to get to know this awesome sensor [Adafruit APDS-9960](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3595). It is capable of sensing proximity, light (also RGB), and gesture!

<img src="https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/970x728/3595-06.jpg" width=200>

Connect it to your pi with Qwiic connector and try running the three example scripts individually to see what the sensor is capable of doing!

```
(circuitpython) pi@ixe00:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub/Lab 4 $ python proximity_test.py
...
(circuitpython) pi@ixe00:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub/Lab 4 $ python gesture_test.py
...
(circuitpython) pi@ixe00:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub/Lab 4 $ python color_test.py
...
```

You can go the the [Adafruit GitHub Page](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_APDS9960) to see more examples for this sensor!

#### Rotary Encoder

A rotary encoder is an electro-mechanical device that converts the angular position to analog or digital output signals. The [Adafruit rotary encoder](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4991#technical-details) we ordered for you came with separate breakout board and encoder itself, that is, they will need to be soldered if you have not yet done so! We will be bringing the soldering station to the lab class for you to use, also, you can go to the MakerLAB to do the soldering off-class. Here is some [guidance on soldering](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-guide-excellent-soldering/preparation) from Adafruit. When you first solder, get someone who has done it before (ideally in the MakerLAB environment). It is a good idea to review this material beforehand so you know what to look at.

### Physical considerations for sensing

Usually, sensors need to be positioned in specific locations or orientations to make them useful for their application. Now that you've tried a bunch of the sensors, pick one that you would like to use, and an application where you use the output of that sensor for an interaction. For example, you can use a distance sensor to measure someone's height if you position it overhead and get them to stand under it.

</details>

**\*\*\*Draw 5 sketches of different ways you might use your sensor, and how the larger device needs to be shaped in order to make the sensor useful.\*\*\***

<mark> For this lab, we decided to begin our ideation by considering different kinds of a type of general-purpose game controller. We start off with an open design space, considering a generalized 2D game. Think of classic cell phone games that would be based off a grid of pixels. At a minimum, this controller would have up, down, left, and right controls. </mark>

**\*\*\*What are some things these sketches raise as questions? What do you need to physically prototype to understand how to anwer those questions?\*\*\***

<mark> As we decided to narrow down our ideas further, we found that having a specific kind of game made the design of our interaction far more deliberate and filled with intention, so we decided to select the game Snake as a preliminary game to design our controller off of. The classic Snake made use of up, down, left, and right controls. Furthermore, the game relied on timing and precision in order for a player to navigate the winding path that the snake creates. Because of this, we wanted to think about how we might be able to place a directional pad or some other form of directional movement analog, in a way that is both playful but also takes into account the affordance of instant control over the snake character. </mark>

**\*\*\*Pick one of these designs to prototype.\*\*\***

<mark> We created a very simple prototype utilizing a row of four tactile switches to denote each direction and coded a very simple prototype of the Snake game through the Raspberry Pi. While this set up was simple, we wanted to expand the control aspect further and started to take inspiration directly from the snake character itself for our physical housing and control enclosure.</mark>

### Part D

### Physical considerations for displaying information and housing parts

Here is a Pi with a paper faceplate on it to turn it into a display interface:

<img src="https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Developing-and-Designing-Interactive-Devices/blob/2020Fall/images/paper_if.png?raw=true"  width="250"/>

This is fine, but the mounting of the display constrains the display location and orientation a lot. Also, it really only works for applications where people can come and stand over the Pi, or where you can mount the Pi to the wall.

Here is another prototype for a paper display:

<img src="https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Developing-and-Designing-Interactive-Devices/blob/2020Fall/images/b_box.png?raw=true"  width="250"/>

Your kit includes these [SparkFun Qwiic OLED screens](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/17153). These use less power than the MiniTFTs you have mounted on the GPIO pins of the Pi, but, more importantly, they can be more flexibly mounted elsewhere on your physical interface. The way you program this display is almost identical to the way you program a Pi display. Take a look at `oled_test.py` and some more of the [Adafruit examples](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_SSD1306/tree/master/examples).

<p float="left">
<img src="https://cdn.sparkfun.com//assets/parts/1/6/1/3/5/17153-SparkFun_Qwiic_OLED_Display__0.91_in__128x32_-01.jpg" height="200" />

</p>

It holds a Pi and usb power supply, and provides a front stage on which to put writing, graphics, LEDs, buttons or displays.

This design can be made by scoring a long strip of corrugated cardboard of width X, with the following measurements:

| Y height of box <br> <sub><sup>- thickness of cardboard</sup></sub> | Z depth of box <br><sub><sup>- thickness of cardboard</sup></sub> | Y height of box | Z depth of box | H height of faceplate <br><sub><sup>\* \* \* \* _ (don't make this too short) _ \* \* \* \*</sup></sub> |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

Fold the first flap of the strip so that it sits flush against the back of the face plate, and tape, velcro or hot glue it in place. This will make a H x X interface, with a box of Z x X footprint (which you can adapt to the things you want to put in the box) and a height Y in the back.

Here is an example:

<img src="https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Developing-and-Designing-Interactive-Devices/blob/2020Fall/images/horoscope.png?raw=true"  width="250"/>

Think about how you want to present the information about what your sensor is sensing! Design a paper display for your project that communicates the state of the Pi and a sensor. Ideally you should design it so that you can slide the Pi out to work on the circuit or programming, and then slide it back in and reattach a few wires to be back in operation.

</details>

**\*\*\*Sketch 5 designs for how you would physically position your display and any buttons or knobs needed to interact with it.\*\*\***

<mark> We decided to incorporate another theme for this section, creating enclosures and controllers that mimic the characters within classic 2D games (e.g., utilizing an actual racket for the game of pong, or having two separate sticks that would represent oars for a rowing game). For our main example of this lab, the controller for the classic snake game would be a long, snake-like object that would control the snake character, depending on which direction the player would bend the object. We started to consider how this large form would break down into its simple, modular parts. </mark>

**\*\*\*What are some things these sketches raise as questions? What do you need to physically prototype to understand how to anwer those questions?\*\*\***

<mark> While these controllers vary significantly in terms of their actuation and use case (i.e., specific game they are designed for), a few similarities arise. For one, they all deal with certain objects that are already indicative of normal human interaction (i.e. rackets, oars, etc.) or are familiar objects that are supposedly mapping onto a character in the game. Therefore, they make use of the mental model approach for physicalization, whereby phsyical objects that mimic digital assets give the impression of control over those assets. The question still remains if these mental models will be sufficient enough for people to understand how to play each game utilizing the control controller. That would open the door for user testing. </mark>

**\*\*\*Pick one of these display designs to integrate into your prototype.\*\*\***

<mark> We decided to take inspiration from the actual skeleton of a snake and consider its individual vertebrae as an underlying scaffolding for our controller. In the same way the vertebrae can bend and undulate in on themselves, so too would our controller. Through its undulations, the succeeding vertebrae would then click on ubiquitiously placed buttons on the preceding vertebrae, thus creating a type of controller that is activated through its bending. </mark>

**\*\*\*Explain the rationale for the design.\*\*\*** (e.g. Does it need to be a certain size or form or need to be able to be seen from a certain distance?)

- <mark> We wanted it to be unit based, so we created a general purpose, laser cut module in Rhino 3D that we would repeat over and over again across the assembly attached together by a string (i.e., beads on a string).</mark>
- <mark> Spaces and cavities need to be included so that the electronics and wiring could be able to pass through the assembly, in addition to being able to attach buttons onto the sides of each vertebrae section.</mark>
- <mark> The final assembly needs to be robust enough for it to hold together and be held by a user in both hands, but also flexible enough for it to be able to bend and undulate properly (i.e. press side buttons).</mark>

<mark> Unfortunately, our cardboard prototype, as it stands, was not sufficient enough to create an undulating motion through movement at the top of the assembly. Our current prototype needs to provide some tensile strength in between each cardboard vertebrae as well. This can possibly be achieved by including some crimps or knots in between each vertebrae or by increasing the tension of the rope at each end to create a more tense structure that's able to naturally orient itself to its original straight position whenver the user bends it. More electronics integration and iterations on this prototype are yet to come. </mark>

# LAB PART 2

### Part 2

Following exploration and reflection from Part 1, complete the "looks like," "works like" and "acts like" prototypes for your design, reiterated below.

<details>
	<summary><strong>Part E</strong></summary>

### Part E

#### Chaining Devices and Exploring Interaction Effects

For Part 2, you will design and build a fun interactive prototype using multiple inputs and outputs. This means chaining Qwiic and STEMMA QT devices (e.g., buttons, encoders, sensors, servos, displays) and/or combining with traditional breadboard prototyping (e.g., LEDs, buzzers, etc.).

**Your prototype should:**

- Combine at least two different types of input and output devices, inspired by your physical considerations from Part 1.
- Be playful, creative, and demonstrate multi-input/multi-output interaction.

**Document your system with:**

- Code for your multi-device demo
- Photos and/or video of the working prototype in action
- A simple interaction diagram or sketch showing how inputs and outputs are connected and interact
- Written reflection: What did you learn about multi-input/multi-output interaction? What was fun, surprising, or challenging?

**Questions to consider:**

- What new types of interaction become possible when you combine two or more sensors or actuators?
- How does the physical arrangement of devices (e.g., where the encoder or sensor is placed) change the user experience?
- What happens if you use one device to control or modulate another (e.g., encoder sets a threshold, sensor triggers an action)?
- How does the system feel if you swap which device is "primary" and which is "secondary"?

Try chaining different combinations and document what you discover!

See encoder_accel_servo_dashboard.py in the Lab 4 folder for an example of chaining together three devices.

**`Lab 4/encoder_accel_servo_dashboard.py`**

#### Using Multiple Qwiic Buttons: Changing I2C Address (Physically & Digitally)

If you want to use more than one Qwiic Button in your project, you must give each button a unique I2C address. There are two ways to do this:

##### 1. Physically: Soldering Address Jumpers

On the back of the Qwiic Button, you'll find four solder jumpers labeled A0, A1, A2, and A3. By bridging these with solder, you change the I2C address. Only one button on the chain can use the default address (0x6F).

**Address Table:**

| A3  | A2  | A1  | A0  | Address (hex) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | ------------- |
| 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0x6F          |
| 0   | 0   | 0   | 1   | 0x6E          |
| 0   | 0   | 1   | 0   | 0x6D          |
| 0   | 0   | 1   | 1   | 0x6C          |
| 0   | 1   | 0   | 0   | 0x6B          |
| 0   | 1   | 0   | 1   | 0x6A          |
| 0   | 1   | 1   | 0   | 0x69          |
| 0   | 1   | 1   | 1   | 0x68          |
| 1   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0x67          |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ...           |

For example, if you solder A0 closed (leave A1, A2, A3 open), the address becomes 0x6E.

**Soldering Tips:**

- Use a small amount of solder to bridge the pads for the jumper you want to close.
- Only one jumper needs to be closed for each address change (see table above).
- Power cycle the button after changing the jumper.

##### 2. Digitally: Using Software to Change Address

You can also change the address in software (temporarily or permanently) using the example script `qwiic_button_ex6_changeI2CAddress.py` in the Lab 4 folder. This is useful if you want to reassign addresses without soldering.

Run the script and follow the prompts:

```bash
python qwiic_button_ex6_changeI2CAddress.py
```

Enter the new address (e.g., 5B for 0x5B) when prompted. Power cycle the button after changing the address.

**Note:** The software method is less foolproof and you need to make sure to keep track of which button has which address!

##### Using Multiple Buttons in Code

After setting unique addresses, you can use multiple buttons in your script. See these example scripts in the Lab 4 folder:

- **`qwiic_1_button.py`**: Basic example for reading a single Qwiic Button (default address 0x6F). Run with:

  ```bash
  python qwiic_1_button.py
  ```

- **`qwiic_button_led_demo.py`**: Demonstrates using two Qwiic Buttons at different addresses (e.g., 0x6F and 0x6E) and controlling their LEDs. Button 1 toggles its own LED; Button 2 toggles both LEDs. Run with:
  ```bash
  python qwiic_button_led_demo.py
  ```

Here is a minimal code example for two buttons:

```python
import qwiic_button

# Default button (0x6F)
button1 = qwiic_button.QwiicButton()
# Button with A0 soldered (0x6E)
button2 = qwiic_button.QwiicButton(0x6E)

button1.begin()
button2.begin()

while True:
		if button1.is_button_pressed():
				print("Button 1 pressed!")
		if button2.is_button_pressed():
				print("Button 2 pressed!")
```

### PCF8574 GPIO Expander: Add More Pins Over I²C

Sometimes your Pi’s header GPIO pins are already full (e.g., with a display or HAT). That’s where an I²C GPIO expander comes in handy.

We use the Adafruit PCF8574 I²C GPIO Expander, which gives you 8 extra digital pins over I²C. It’s a great way to prototype with LEDs, buttons, or other components on the breadboard without worrying about pin conflicts—similar to how Arduino users often expand their pinouts when prototyping physical interactions.

**Why is this useful?**

- You only need two wires (I²C: SDA + SCL) to unlock 8 extra GPIOs.
- It integrates smoothly with CircuitPython and Blinka.
- It allows a clean prototyping workflow when the Pi’s 40-pin header is already occupied by displays, HATs, or sensors.
- Makes breadboard setups feel more like an Arduino-style prototyping environment where it’s easy to wire up interaction elements.

**Demo Script:** `Lab 4/gpio_expander.py`

<p align="center">
    <img src="gpio_leds.gif" alt="GPIO Expander LED Demo" width="400"/>
</p>

We connected 8 LEDs (through 220 Ω resistors) to the expander and ran a little light show. The script cycles through three patterns:

- Chase (one LED at a time, left to right)
- Knight Rider (back-and-forth sweep)
- Disco (random blink chaos)

Every few runs, the script swaps to the next pattern automatically:

```bash
python gpio_expander.py
```

This is a playful way to visualize how the expander works, but the same technique applies if you wanted to prototype buttons, switches, or other interaction elements. It’s a lightweight, flexible addition to your prototyping toolkit.

### Servo Control with SparkFun Servo pHAT

For this lab, you will use the **SparkFun Servo pHAT** to control a micro servo (such as the Miuzei MS18 or similar 9g servo). The Servo pHAT stacks directly on top of the Adafruit Mini PiTFT (135×240) display without pin conflicts:

- The Mini PiTFT uses SPI (GPIO22, 23, 24, 25) for display and buttons ([SPI pinout](https://pinout.xyz/pinout/spi)).
- The Servo pHAT uses I²C (GPIO2 & 3) for the PCA9685 servo driver ([I2C pinout](https://pinout.xyz/pinout/i2c)).
- Since SPI and I²C are separate buses, you can use both boards together.
  **⚡ Power:**
- Plug a USB-C cable into the Servo pHAT to provide enough current for the servos. The Pi itself should still be powered by its own USB-C supply. Do NOT power servos from the Pi’s 5V rail.

<p align="center">
    <img src="Servo_pHAT.gif" alt="Servo pHAT Demo" width="400"/>
</p>

**Basic Python Example:**
We provide a simple example script: `Lab 4/pi_servo_hat_test.py` (requires the `pi_servo_hat` Python package).
Run the example:

```
python pi_servo_hat_test.py
```

For more details and advanced usage, see the [official SparkFun Servo pHAT documentation](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/pi-servo-phat-v2-hookup-guide/all#resources-and-going-further).
A servo motor is a rotary actuator that allows for precise control of angular position. The position is set by the width of an electrical pulse (PWM). You can read [this Adafruit guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-arduino-lesson-14-servo-motors/servo-motors) to learn more about how servos work.

### <mark> Proof of Concept Testing (Acts Like)</mark>

<mark> Building on what we did in part one, we attempted to test a proof of concept (i.e., act likes prototpye) from our first cardboard controller. We had people use it like a real controller, imagining they were controlling the snake game on a grid using the cardboard pieces. The results were mixed - some liked how flexible it was, while others wanted it to be stiffer. Also, the cardboard pieces slid around on a larger delta depending on how long the string was. So, when we were putting it together, we’d need to add some kind of netting to keep them in place. People also wanted a handle or base to hold the controller, not just holding the bottom. </mark>

### <mark> Assembly Process </mark>

<mark> We went ahead and built the assembly process, just like we did with the first prototype. We used a laser cutter to cut out different cardboard modules and tied them together with a long string. This time, the units were smaller than the first ones, and they’d be longer accounting for a thinner frame. That way, we could place more layers on top of the assembly (i.e., netting, cotton, fabric, etc.). </mark>

<mark> _**AI Usage:** Utilized assistance from ChatGPT for the writing of code._ </mark>

<mark> _**Pros:** because the snake game is very ubiquitous and a common coding project, ChatGPT was able to produce a very simple boiler plate example with minimal reprompting. Adding variety to the system also was pretty simple as again the game was rather rudimentary and so it could be generally padded upon through further iterations_ </mark>

<mark> _**Cons:** Less so about the context of the project and more so about the limitations of ChatGPT model 5-o. This model has a new cork where it continually asks for questions and specificity on what your coding. To some extent, it's useful to make sure that the LLM is not making assumptions about your code, but at some point, it becomes rather annoying and a hindrance to efficiency. Asking for specificity on the color of the graphics, the speed of the game, and even each stage of the interaction becomes tedious. ._ </mark>

<mark> The assembled cardboard prototype (i.e., works like prototype) used the pHAT module to connect a qwiic connect joystick and a qwiic connect IMU. The joystick was placed in the middle of the assembly, giving the user control at that point. The IMU was also attached to that point. We coded a simple snake game using pyGame. The game can only be played through the Pi desktop GUI interface, so to run it, you’d need VNC Viewer to access the Pi’s desktop view and then open the game from there. </mark>

### <mark> Material Considerations </mark>

<mark> For the final assembly, we decided to add cotton between each vertebrae. This way, the structure becomes more rigid and won’t move as freely as it did before. The entire assembly is still bendable, but it’s now extra cushioned with the cotton in between. To add more comfort and make the controller more friendly, we used stretchable fabric from the MakerLAB to sew up a soft enclosure. We cut up a long piece and sewed it together into a long sock-like form to fit the entire cardboard assembly. To keep our Pi situated on the soft plushie, we also added a small pocket to the fabric. </mark>

<mark> After testing the soft fabric assembly (i.e., looks like prototype) with users, we got some feedback that’s worth keeping in mind for future versions. First, while the soft cotton made the plushie somewhat comfortable, the cardboard inside doesn’t feel as soft as we’d hoped. It’s also hard to tell where exactly to bend the plushy to control the snake. We should make it clear where each direction is mapped to each bend in the future by adding some sort of sign or signifier for the user. Second, the game is simple, but it’s too fast for most people to keep up with. We should make it slower so that users can respond more easily. The original version had a death penalty for touching the edges of the screen, but that’s too harsh. Lastly, the plushie, while cute, could benefit from more snake-like design choices such as the inclusion of scales or different colors (i.e., green, black, yellow, etc.). </mark>

<mark> _"The box features an off-white rectangular box with a streamlined "S"-shaped cutout window in the center. Through the window, you can see the soft, gray, snake-shaped handle inside, cleverly secured so that it appears to "swim" within the box. The brand logo is featured at the top, and the slogan is displayed below. The sides of the box feature our cute illustrations for racing, flying, and snake games, creating a simple yet dynamic feel."_ </mark>

<mark> _"Advertisement for a soft, plushie, fabric-based snake game controller. The controller is held vertically by two hands with a clear height difference: the left hand is positioned higher, and the right hand is positioned lower. Both hands naturally grip the snake body, creating a "weapon-like" vertical hold, aimed upwards. The snake controller is a single, long serpentine body, with only one head at the very top. The bottom end tapers into a natural snake tail. The snake has a soft, light grey fabric texture, with subtle segmentation/texture to represent its joints/body. The snake's head is cute and friendly, with small black eyes and a pink, forked tongue sticking out. The background is a vibrant, stylized sky, featuring fluffy white clouds, streaks of golden light (like sun rays or flight trails), and a bright, ethereal light source at the top center. The overall aesthetic is soft, playful, and adventurous. Below the image, the main headline is "Bend the rules." in a clean, modern white font. Below that, in a smaller white font, is the sub-headline "Soar. Shaped by you."_ </mark>

<mark> _"Dynamic and abstract game concept art for a stylized racing game. The perspective is a first-person driver's point-of-view, rushing down an abstract race track made of glowing neon light. The track twists and turns into a distant horizon, creating an immense sense of speed through motion blur and long-exposure light trails. The color palette is vibrant, with bright cyan, magenta, and orange light against a dark, clean background. The art style is energetic, futuristic, and minimalist, focusing purely on the feeling of speed and flow. Do not include any car, cockpit, UI elements, text, hands, or game controllers."_ </mark>

### <mark> Inspiration </mark>

<mark> As stated before, our design process was inspired by mimicking the bone structure of a snake itself, considering that we were utilizing the snake game as a basis for how we were going to design our controller. By mimicking each vertebrae on the spine, we were able to use a bottom of approach to design and create an abstract system that allows us to use each single node of the controller in a playful way. </mark>
